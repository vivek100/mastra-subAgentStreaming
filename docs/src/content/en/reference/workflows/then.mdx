# Workflow.then()

The `.then()` method creates a sequential dependency between workflow steps, ensuring steps execute in a specific order.

## Usage example

```typescript copy
workflow.then(step1).then(step2);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "step",
      type: "Step",
      description:
        "The step instance that should execute after the previous step completes",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "NewWorkflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>

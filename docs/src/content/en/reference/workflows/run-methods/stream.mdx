# Run.stream()

The `.stream()` method allows you to monitor the execution of a workflow run, providing real-time updates on the status of steps.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "inputData",
      type: "z.infer<TInput>",
      description: "Input data that matches the workflow's input schema",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "runtimeContext",
      type: "RuntimeContext",
      description: "Runtime context data to use during workflow execution",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "stream",
      type: "ReadableStream<StreamEvent>",
      description: "A readable stream that emits workflow execution events in real-time",
    },
    {
      name: "getWorkflowState",
      type: "() => Promise<WorkflowResult<TOutput, TSteps>>",
      description: "A function that returns a promise resolving to the final workflow result",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const { getWorkflowState } = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data"
  }
});

const result = await getWorkflowState();
```

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`tool-call`**: A tool call is initiated
- **`tool-call-streaming-start`**: Tool call streaming begins
- **`tool-call-delta`**: Incremental tool output updates
- **`step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`step-finish`**: A step finishes execution
- **`finish`**: Workflow execution completes
